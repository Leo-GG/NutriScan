# NutriScan: AI-Powered Dietary Analysis App

NutriScan is an interactive web application developed in Python using the Streamlit framework. It helps users analyze their dietary nutrient intake and provides personalized recommendations for a balanced diet. The app leverages Large Language Models through the Groq API for diet analysis and meal planning.

This project was developed by Leonardo Garma and Nuria Moreno as an entry for the [Data4Sustainability challenge 2024](https://www.datais.es/dataton-sostenibilidad).

## Features

### 1. Diet Input & Estimation
- **FAOSTAT Data Profiles**: Load and customize dietary profiles from the FAOSTAT data used in the challenge
- **LLM Estimation**: Use AI to estimate nutrient content from text descriptions of meals
- **Voice Input**: Describe your diet using voice input
- **Manual Input**: Enter nutrient values manually

### 2. Diet Analysis
- Visual representation of nutrient intake compared to reference values
- Color-coded status indicators (Deficient, Borderline, Adequate, High, Excess)
- Detailed analysis table with specific values and percentages

### 3. Recommendations
- Personalized dietary recommendations based on analysis results
- Specific food suggestions to address deficiencies or excesses
- Nutrient-specific tips for better absorption and intake
- AI-generated weekly meal plans tailored to your country of residence

## Resources

- **Frontend & Backend**: Python with Streamlit
- **Data Analysis**: Pandas, Plotly
- **AI Integration**: Groq API with LangChain
- **Data Sources**: FAOSTAT, custom nutrient databases

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- A Groq API key (get one at https://console.groq.com)
- pip (Python package installer)
- For voice input: Working microphone and appropriate audio drivers

### Local Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leo-gg/nutriscan.git
cd nutriscan
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# Linux/MacOS
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install required packages:

```bash
# Update pip first
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

# Install all requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note: For voice input functionality, you might need additional system-level packages:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev python3-pyaudio

# MacOS (using Homebrew)
brew install portaudio
pip install pyaudio

# Windows
# If PyAudio installation fails, try:
pip install pipwin
pipwin install pyaudio
```

4. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add your Groq API key:

```bash
# Create .env file and add your API key
echo "GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here" > .env
```

Replace `your_groq_api_key_here` with your actual Groq API key.

5. Run the application:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

The app should now be running on http://localhost:8501

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during installation:

1. **PyAudio installation fails**:
   - Windows: Try using pipwin as shown above
   - Linux: Make sure you have portaudio19-dev installed
   - MacOS: Install portaudio via Homebrew first

2. **Package conflicts**:
   - Try installing in a fresh virtual environment
   - Make sure you're using Python 3.8 or higher
   - Update all packages to their latest versions

3. **Streamlit issues**:
   - Check if port 8501 is available
   - Try clearing the Streamlit cache: `streamlit cache clear`
   - Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed

### Important Notes

- Keep your `.env` file private and never commit it to version control
- Voice input requires a working microphone and appropriate audio drivers
- Some features require an active internet connection
- The application has been tested on Python 3.8-3.11
- You need a valid Groq API key to use the AI features
